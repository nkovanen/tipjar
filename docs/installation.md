# Installation and controlled updates

Install on the machine that runs your agent. A remote Paseo agent needs the CLI,
Git and `gh` on its host, not merely on the device displaying the conversation.
The package requires Python 3.10+ and has no Python runtime dependencies. Build
and installer tools have their own Python requirements. Full regression coverage
is Linux-only. Windows/macOS CI is limited to bounded host-context stdin and
installed offline CLI smoke checks, not the full Git, cache or evidence workflows.
In the unreleased v0.3.0 route, `verify --host-context-stdin` uses a bounded binary
reader in an isolated Python child with a five-second deadline. It works with
pipes and redirected files without relying on POSIX `select()`; timed-out readers
are terminated and reaped. The running Python interpreter must remain available
to launch that child. This adds no runtime dependency.
Scope and containment decisions use the literal POSIX paths Git reports on
every OS. Backslashes, drive letters and case are never normalized, so a path
that would match only after normalization is out of scope.

## Current Tipjar source install

Current development is in `nkovanen/tipjar`. Install the unreleased candidate:

```sh
pipx install 'git+https://github.com/nkovanen/tipjar.git@main'
tipjar --version
agent-contrib --version
```

`main` is a moving source target. Replace it with a reviewed full commit SHA for
a reproducible install. This is not a published 0.3.0 release. Authenticate GitHub
reads separately with `gh auth login`.

## Historical Agent Contrib release install

The following commands select the original Agent Contrib v0.2.0 release, which
has no `tipjar` command. They are retained for compatibility and rollback.

After installing [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/how-to/install-pipx.html), Git
and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```sh
pipx install 'git+https://github.com/nkovanen/agent-contrib.git@v0.2.0'
agent-contrib --version
agent-contrib instructions
```

Run `pipx ensurepath` and restart the terminal/agent if the command cannot be
found. Authenticate `gh` using its own supported mechanism, and check with
`gh auth status`. Do not paste credentials into a task contract or chat. No
LightCraft checkout, subscription to a particular model, or repository-specific
setup is needed for discovery.

A failed GitHub read never echoes `gh` output, which can contain credentials.
HTTP 404 is reported as not found or not visible to this account (check the
repository and issue names, or private access), HTTP 401 as an authentication
failure (`gh auth status`), and anything else as a generic auth, access or rate
limit failure. The error code stays `api_error` and the command still fails.

For a standard virtual environment instead of pipx:

```sh
python3 -m venv "$HOME/.local/share/agent-contrib-0.2.0"
"$HOME/.local/share/agent-contrib-0.2.0/bin/python" -m pip install \
  'git+https://github.com/nkovanen/agent-contrib.git@v0.2.0'
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/agent-contrib-0.2.0/bin:$PATH"
agent-contrib --version
```

Persist that PATH entry in the environment used to start your harness. An
immutable release commit may replace the tag in the Git URL when exact commit
pinning is required. Installation uses standard Python build tools, not a
custom shell installer. Nothing is published to PyPI in this release.

## Tipjar command compatibility

Tipjar describes gifting useful agent work to projects. The unreleased candidate
adds `tipjar` as an alias for `agent-contrib`; the published v0.2.0 installation
above does not include it. Install a reviewed candidate containing the alias as
[described below](#testing-the-unreleased-v030-candidate), then check both
`agent-contrib --version` and `tipjar --version` in your agent's environment.
For example, `tipjar instructions` reads the same workflow as
`agent-contrib instructions`.

The distribution is still `agent-contrib` and the module is still
`agent_contribute` (`python -m agent_contribute`). Help and output identifiers
keep the canonical name. Both commands export the same `agent-contribute` Skill;
keep its existing directory and invocation. Repository invitations, `jar` inspection and bounded `find` discovery are implemented
in this candidate; see the [README](../README.md) for their authority boundaries.

## Install the Skill

The installed package is the canonical source. Export creates a new file and
prints its SHA-256; it refuses to overwrite an existing file or symlink.

| Harness | Personal Skill file |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/agent-contribute/SKILL.md` |
| Codex | `~/.agents/skills/agent-contribute/SKILL.md` |
| Paseo | Use the underlying provider's path on the agent host |
| Other | Export to that harness's Skill directory or load the Markdown as reusable instructions |

For Claude Code:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude/skills/agent-contribute"
agent-contrib skill --output "$HOME/.claude/skills/agent-contribute/SKILL.md"
```

For Codex:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agents/skills/agent-contribute"
agent-contrib skill --output "$HOME/.agents/skills/agent-contribute/SKILL.md"
```

These locations follow [Claude Code's Skill documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)
and [Codex's Skill documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills).
Project-local Skill directories are also supported by those harnesses, but a
personal install avoids per-project setup. Restart the harness if it has cached
its Skill catalog. Say “Go help owner/repo.” Claude Code also supports explicit
`/agent-contribute`; Codex supports explicit `$agent-contribute` invocation.

On Windows, use PowerShell paths and `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force` instead
of `mkdir -p`; for example:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME/.agents/skills/agent-contribute"
agent-contrib skill --output "$HOME/.agents/skills/agent-contribute/SKILL.md"
```

The same CLI commands apply; Windows CI covers only the transport and offline
smoke checks described above. A virtual environment uses `Scripts/python.exe`
and `Scripts` on PATH.

## Compatibility and updates

The published CLI **0.2.0** bundles task and evidence schemas **0.1**, workflow guidance and
the thin adapter together. `agent-contrib instructions` reports this support set.
The unreleased CLI **0.3.0** also bundles explicit task/evidence schema **0.2**
and host-context schemas **0.1** and **0.2**; default contracts remain 0.1. Unknown versions fail closed. The Skill intentionally has no independent copy
of the protocol: it asks the installed CLI for instructions every time.

Updates are explicit. Read the target release notes (for 0.2 to 0.3, see
[upgrading](upgrading.md)), back up contracts/evidence
and the existing Skill, then deliberately reinstall a chosen Git tag. For
example, reinstalling this release with pipx is:

```sh
pipx install --force 'git+https://github.com/nkovanen/agent-contrib.git@v0.2.0'
agent-contrib --version
agent-contrib skill --output ./agent-contribute-SKILL.new.md
```

Inspect and compare the exported file before replacing the installed Skill using
your normal file tools. Do not bypass an export failure by blindly deleting an
existing customization. Rerun verification after changing relevant inputs. No
silent update checks, migrations or downloads happen while using the CLI.

To uninstall the CLI, use `pipx uninstall agent-contrib`; remove the Skill file
separately if desired. Existing task/evidence files are yours and are not removed.

## Testing the unreleased v0.3.0 candidate

The published v0.2.0 tag is unchanged. To test the new route, create a separate
virtual environment and install the exact reviewed candidate commit from GitHub.
Replace `PUSHED_FULL_COMMIT_SHA` with the full immutable SHA supplied by its
review; it must already be pushed to GitHub:

```sh
python3 -m venv "$HOME/.local/share/agent-contrib-candidate"
"$HOME/.local/share/agent-contrib-candidate/bin/python" -m pip install \
  'git+https://github.com/nkovanen/tipjar.git@PUSHED_FULL_COMMIT_SHA'
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/agent-contrib-candidate/bin:$PATH"
agent-contrib --version   # must print 0.3.0, not 0.2.0
```

A local integration commit may not be pushed yet. In that case, install a clean
`git archive` export of that exact commit into the new environment instead; do not
substitute a different remote commit or a mutable working tree.

The exported Skill runs the unqualified `agent-contrib instructions`, so the
agent uses whichever installation comes first on its PATH. Persist the PATH
entry above in the environment that launches the harness and restart it. Then
check that the unqualified `agent-contrib --version` prints 0.3.0 inside that
environment before exporting the Skill. Record the installed commit, CLI version
and exported hash. To return to the release, remove the PATH entry. Keep the
published installation separate; do not install a v0.3.0 tag that does not exist.
Use the [human/host handoff](host-authorization.md) at authorization boundaries.
