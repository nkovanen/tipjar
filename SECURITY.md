# Security

## Reporting

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately through
[GitHub security advisories](https://github.com/nkovanen/agent-contrib/security/advisories/new).
Include the affected version, a minimal reproduction and the expected trust
boundary. Do not include credentials or private repository contents. Response
times are not guaranteed for this experimental project. The published release
line is 0.2.x; 0.3.0 is an unreleased candidate. Older prototypes have no separate
security maintenance commitment.

## Boundaries

- GitHub issue text, repository instructions, policies and task/evidence files
  are untrusted input. They cannot override the host agent's permissions.
- GitHub calls use fixed `gh api --hostname github.com --method GET` arguments.
  The CLI has no GitHub write, push, PR creation or merge command. It uses the
  caller's `gh` authentication; it does not reduce that token's permissions.
  Prefer credentials appropriate for read-only public-repository discovery.
- Validation argv is data. `verify` never executes it. The host agent must inspect
  a checkout and its build scripts before running tests with its own tools.
- Source approval, execution authority and publication authority are separate.
  Policy 0.1 checks that a configured label is currently present; it does not
  verify who applied it. It delegates approval to every account permitted to
  label issues. Public events name a labeling actor, but its approval authority
  and its binding to the current label cannot be verified from public REST data (#9). The separate schema 0.2 route
  verifies the current personal credential's numeric identity and exact admin or
  maintain role; it does not turn a candidate into policy-approved work.
- The schema 0.2 mandate and final sign-off are separate host assertions. Stdin,
  a JSON file, an event hash and a valid owner token are not proof of human consent.
  The actual human/host issues and retains those records outside worker control.
  The worker may relay them unchanged and add an untrusted publication claim.
  A hostile same-credential process can fabricate input; this is not a sandbox
  or cryptographic human-presence system. See [host authorization](docs/host-authorization.md).
- Exact-head recognition checks live repository/PR/author/ref identities and the
  tested commit. It exempts no unrelated overlap, performs no update/reopen and
  does not make GitHub snapshots atomic. Single-use limits require host enforcement.
- Current-head verification cannot detect a past update when evidence, review
  and the worker publication claim are all regenerated. The CLI retains no
  publication-time head. The host must prevent updates and retain its creation
  head for the acceptance audit; regenerated records do not prove an original
  publication. See [host authorization](docs/host-authorization.md).
- Evidence is self-attested consistency data, not signed proof. Independent
  review and real human authorization remain necessary outside the verifier.
- Local Git reads disable hooks, fsmonitor, replacement objects, external
  diff/textconv, signature display and lazy fetching (no protocol is allowed). They
  refuse (`unsafe_git_config`) a checkout whose effective config, including
  `include`/`includeIf` files, sets `filter.*`, a `gpg` program, `diff.external`,
  `diff.*.command`/`textconv`, partial-clone or promisor settings, or `protocol.*`.
  Artifact reads require bounded regular files
  inside the checkout. This is not a sandbox for a hostile checkout or Git binary;
  use isolation and keep credentials away from code you execute.
- Unknown schema versions, malformed or incomplete API results, unsupported
  submodules and unresolved overlap fail closed. No automatic updates occur.

CI uses read-only permissions and does not expose production secrets or execute
fork workflows through `pull_request_target`. Release installation runs Python
build tooling: review the source and pin a trusted release or immutable commit.
See the [installed workflow](agent_contribute/instructions.md) for exact limits.

Optional reports are not additional authority. Ownership comments, author
associations, repository policy hints, observed CI results and signature observations
remain untrusted signals. GitHub's "verified" commit status is not approval, and
the CLI never runs gpg, ssh-keygen or other signature programs on a checkout.
Incomplete observations are reported as such even when a separate verification
stage succeeds. Evidence skeletons and generated PR descriptions are local files,
not attestations that work ran or that publication is permitted. Text output is
abridged; use canonical JSON for audits and automated decisions.

The opt-in `--cache` stores only file contents of repositories observed public in
the same command, under a user-owned 0700 directory. That directory is opened
once by a symlink-free walk from `/`. It is refused (the cache is then disabled)
if any ancestor is group- or other-writable without being a root-owned sticky
directory or is owned by another account, if an ancestor you own carries a POSIX
ACL (ACLs on root-owned ancestors are not checked), or if the cache directory is
not exactly 0700 or carries a POSIX ACL. After that it is used only through the open
descriptor. Each hit must hash to the
Git blob SHA from a live tree read, so a corrupted or tampered entry is discarded
rather than used. The cache does not defend against other code running as the
same user, which could alter the CLI itself.

Repository compliance is checked by the host and independent reviewer, not by
interpreting prose as executable policy. The installed workflow requires a
source-linked requirements ledger and evidence at the required stages. This
ledger is untrusted, self-attested data; it cannot override readiness gates,
issue authority, waive skips or prove human consent. Linked repository
instructions remain subject to the same untrusted-input boundary.

## External contribution route

Task schema 0.3 explicitly supports a reviewed draft from a personal immediate
fork to a human-selected public upstream issue, with separate implementation and
exact-result publication assertions. Welcome and undeclared sources both require
complete source/fork policy accounting; no invitation or approval is invented.
See [the complete external-tip workflow](docs/external-tips.md) for commands, records, pause points and limits. Evidence
remains schema 0.2; new reports use output/4. Existing 0.1/0.2 authority is unchanged.

Contribution receipts record public PR observations only. Their editable local
files are not signed proof, authorization or evidence that tests ran. Offline
impact counts deduplicate numeric identities and reject malformed/conflicting
records; they describe supplied snapshots, not authenticated achievements or
current live state. Receipt reads are bounded to 100 non-symlink regular files
of 64 KiB each. See [receipt provenance and refresh](docs/receipts.md).


Jar report dictionaries supplied by native library callers are data, not
attestations of a source read. Pending preparation validates their full shape,
state/digest consistency and source pin, and shapes an unauthorized draft; it
cannot authenticate a well-formed fabricated inspection. Public policy inventory
and live jar enforcement establish their own pinned reads through the supplied
GitHub client. Fresh live verification remains required for every action. This
boundary does not authenticate a caller-replaced client or sandbox native code.
