name: agent-contribute
description: Use when asked to use Tipjar, tip an open-source project with agent work, give back to projects you use, gift a contribution, help an open-source GitHub repository, select contribution work, or prepare an agent contribution handoff.
---

First run `agent-contrib --format text instructions` and read the workflow it
prints (an older CLI without `--format`: `agent-contrib instructions`, field
`workflow_markdown`). Start with its "Quick path" section if it has one; otherwise
follow the returned workflow directly. The quick path gives the command sequence,
the gates and the points where you must stop. The installed CLI/library owns the protocol,
schemas, compatibility checks and guidance. Follow that workflow for the
repository the user identifies. Build its required
source-linked repository requirements ledger before implementation and have an
independent reviewer check compliance before publication. Passing tests or CLI
gates alone does not establish compliance.

Use `agent-contrib --help` for the installed command surface. When it lists
`schema`, use `agent-contrib schema COMMAND` for the fields of a command's JSON
output; older CLIs without it are still supported. Delegate discovery,
inspection, contract preparation and evidence verification to `agent-contrib discover`, `inspect`, `prepare` and `verify` as directed by the workflow.
Perform implementation through your ordinary tools within the user's actual
authority. Report the CLI's observed results and unresolved gates.

If a contribution command the workflow requires, or a required task/evidence
schema, is unavailable, report that blocker.
Do not invent a substitute workflow. Installation and updates are explicit user
choices; this adapter does not update the CLI or run a model.
